On January 20th 1994 Canadians experienced an unexpected interruption to their television programming: The Canadian Telsat spacecraft Anik E1 and Anik E2 had experienced sudden failures of their gyroscopic guidance systems and had begun to tumble out of control. Later attributed to the phenomena of spacecraft charging, the Anik spacecraft had experienced electrostatic discharge of the gyroscope circuitry causing permanent damage to critical systems. Although engineers were able to restore the gyroscopes of Anik E1, the Anik E2 would never recover, representing a loss of several hundred million dollars \insertref{Leach1995}.

Spacecraft charging has been studied as a disparate field of space physics since the mid twentieth century, with fundamental theories describing the phenomena developed by Irving Langmuir in 1924.
