abstract = {BepiColombo is an interdisciplinary mission to explore Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, carried out jointly between the European Space Agency and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. From dedicated orbits two spacecraft will be studying the planet and its environment. The scientific payload of both spacecraft will provide the detailed information necessary to understand the origin and evolution of the planet itself and its surrounding environment. The scientific objectives focus on a global characterization of Mercury through the investigation of its interior, surface, exosphere and magneto-sphere. In addition, instrumentation onboard BepiColombo will be used to test Einstein's theory of general relativity. Major effort was put into optimizing the scientific return of the mission by defining a payload complement such that individual measurements can be interrelated and complement each other. This paper gives an in-depth overview of BepiColombo spacecraft composite and the mission profile. It describes the suite of scientific instruments on board of the two BepiColombo spacecraft and the science goals of the mission.},

Such effects get particularly important in tenuous plasmas with large Debye lengths. We have used the particle-in-cell code package SPIS to study the close environment of the Rosetta spacecraft, and the impact of the spacecraft-plasma interaction on the electrostatic potential at the position of the Langmuir probes onboard. The simulations show that in the solar wind, photoemission has a bigger impact than wake formation. Spacecraft potential estimates based on Langmuir probe data in the solar wind need to be compensated for these effects when the spacecraft attitude varies. The SPIS simulations are validated by comparison to an independent code. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {—Interactions between hazardous space plasmas and spacecraft surfaces often result in spacecraft charging. Spacecraft charging may disturb the scientific measurements onboard, affect communications, control, and operations of spacecraft, and may be harmful to the health of the electronics on the spacecraft. Several mitigation methods have been proposed or tested in recent years. This paper presents a critical overview on all of the mitigation methods known to date: 1) passive methods using sharp spikes and high secondary emission coefficient surface materials and 2) active methods using controlled emissions of electrons, ions, plasmas, neutral gas, and polar molecules. Paradoxically, emission of low-energy positive ions from a highly negatively charged spacecraft can reduce the charging level, because the ions tend to return and may generate secondary electrons which then escape. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods and illustrate the ideas by means of examples of results obtained on SCATHA and DSCS satellites. Finally, mitigation of deep dielectric charging is briefly discussed},

abstract = {The MESSENGER spacecraft flyby of Mercury on 14 January 2008 provided a new opportunity to study the intrinsic magnetic field of the innermost planet and its interaction with the solar wind. The model presented in this paper is based on the solution of the three-dimensional, bi-fluid equations for solar wind protons and electrons in the absence of mass loading. In this study we provide new estimates of Mer-cury's intrinsic magnetic field and the solar wind conditions that prevailed at the time of the flyby. We show that the location of the boundary layers and the strength of the magnetic field along the spacecraft trajectory can be reproduced with a solar wind ram pressure P sw = 6.8 nPa and a planetary magnetic dipole having a magnitude of 210 R M 3 {\`{A}} nT and an offset of 0.18 R M to the north of the equator, where R M is Mercury's radius. Analysis of the plasma flow reveals the existence of a stable drift belt around the planet; such a belt can account for the locations of diamagnetic decreases observed by the MESSENGER Magnetometer. Moreover, we determine that the ion impact rate at the northern cusp was four times higher than at the southern cusp, a result that provides a possible explanation for the observed north-south asymmetry in exospheric sodium in the neutral tail.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The MESSENGER Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer (FIPS) measured the bulk plasma characteristics of Mercury's magnetosphere and solar wind environment during the spacecraft's first two flybys of the planet on 14 January 2008 (M1) and 6 October 2008 (M2), producing the first measurements of thermal ions in Mercury's magnetosphere. In this work, we identify major features of the Mercury magneto-sphere in the FIPS proton data and describe the data analysis process used for recovery of proton density (n p) and temperature (T p) with a forward modeling technique, required because of limitations in measurement geometry. We focus on three regions where the magnetospheric flow speed is likely to be low and meets our criteria for the recovery process: the M1 plasma sheet and the M1 and M2 dayside and nightside boundary-layer regions. Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions were substantially different between the two flybys, with intense reconnection signatures observed by the Magnetometer during M2 versus a relatively quiet magnetosphere during M1. The recovered ion density and temperature values for the M1 quiet-time plasma sheet yielded n p {\$} 1-10 cm {\`{A}} 3 , T p {\$} 2 {\^{A}} 10 6 K, and plasma b {\$} 2. The nightside boundary-layer proton densities during M1 and M2 were similar, at n p {\$} 4-5 cm {\`{A}} 3 , but the temperature during M1 (T p {\$} 4-8 {\^{A}} 10 6 K) was 50{\%} less than during M2 (T p {\$} 8 {\^{A}} 10 6 K), presumably due to reconnection in the tail. The dayside boundary layer observed during M1 had a density of {\$} 16 cm {\`{A}} 3 and temperature of 2 {\^{A}} 10 6 K, whereas during M2 this region was less dense and hotter (n p {\$} 8 cm {\`{A}} 3 and T p {\$} 10 {\^{A}} 10 6 K), again, most likely due to magnetopause reconnection. Overall, the southward interplanetary magnetic field during M2 clearly produced higher T p in the dayside and nightside magnetosphere, as well as higher plasma b in the nightside boundary, {\$} 20 during M2 compared with {\$} 2 during M1. The proton plasma pressure accounts for only a fraction (24{\%} for M1 and 64{\%} for M2) of the drop in magnetic pressure upon entry into the dayside boundary layer. This result suggests that heavy ions of planetary origin, not considered in this analysis, may provide the ''missing'' pressure. If these planetary ions were hot due to ''pickup'' in the magnetosheath, the required density for pressure balance would be an ion density of {\$} 1 cm {\`{A}} 3 for an ion temperature of {\$} 10 8 K.},

We consider first the explicit formulation highlighting its severe limitations due to the presence of stability constraints. Next we introduce implicit methods designed to remove such constraints. We describe both fully implicit methods based on the use of non-linear iteration solvers and semi-implicit methods based on the linearization of the coupling and on simpler linear solvers. We focus the discussion on the implicit moment method but remark its differences from the direct implicit method. The application of adaptive methods within PIC is discussed. Finally practical considerations about the implementation of the implicit PIC method on massively parallel computers to conduct studies of space weather events are given.},

abstract = {Spacecraft often charge to negative potentials of several kilovolts in eclipse at geosynchronous altitudes. We suggest that optical mirrors at geosynchronous altitudes will charge in sunlight as if in eclipse. Modern mirrors can attain very high reflectance, the reflected light being nearly as intense as the incoming light. With high reflectance, the sunlight photon energy imparted to mirror surfaces is greatly reduced, resulting in little or no photoemission. As a result, mirrors will charge as if they would in eclipse, the equilibrium potential being governed by the balance of currents without photoelectrons. When the plasma electron temperature is high, the equilibrium potential may reach several kilovolts negative, despite sunlight. This occurs often in the morning hours and in severe space weather. We stress that in general, the finite reflectance and Sun angle should be included in calculations of spacecraft charging in sunlight. As an important application for mirror charging, we bring to attention recent news, the Boeing 702 model geosynchronous satellite fleet, featuring two long solar panels on each side. Each solar panel is equipped with two mirrors flanking both sides for sunlight enhancement on the solar cells. The entire satellite fleet has suffered a similar fate, namely, gradual, permanent, and sometimes stepwise degradation. While the true cause of the Boeing solar panels deterioration may never be known, we suggest that sudden development of differential charging between the solar panels and the mirrors on their sides could be the culprit. Differential charging of mirrored solar panels may develop rapidly when the satellite is coming out of eclipse. Indeed, the sudden 25{\%} degradation of PanAmSat PAS-7, a Boeing 702 model satellite, did occur shortly after eclipse exit in the morning of 6 September 2001. Finally, we suggest a simple mitigation method for solving the problem.},

abstract = {Mercury is one of the least explored planets in our solar system. Until the recent flyby of Mercury by MESSENGER, no spacecraft had visited Mercury since Mariner 10 made three flybys: two in 1974 and one in 1975. In order to elucidate the detailed plasma structure and dynamics around Mercury, an orbiter BepiColombo MMO (Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter) is planned to be launched in 2013 as a joint mission between ESA and ISAS/JAXA. Mercury Plasma Particle Experiment (MPPE) was proposed in order to investigate the plasma/particle environment around Mercury. MPPE is a comprehensive instrument package for plasma, high-energy particle and energetic neutral atom measurements. It consists of seven sensors: two Mercury electron analyzers (MEA1 and MEA2), Mercury ion analyzer (MIA), Mercury mass spectrum analyzer (MSA), high-energy particle instrument for electron (HEP-ele), high-energy particle instrument for ion (HEP-ion), and energetic neutrals analyzer (ENA). Since comprehensive full three-dimensional simultaneous measurements of low to high-energy ions and electrons around Mercury as well as measurements of energetic neutral atoms will not be realized before BepiColombo/MMO's arrival at Mercury, it is expected that many unresolved problems concerning the Mercury magnetosphere will be elucidated by the MPPE observation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When a cylindrical or spherical electrode (collector) immersed in an ionized gas is brought to a suitable potential, it becomes surrounded by a symmetrical space-charge region or "sheath" of positive or of negative ions (or electrons). Assuming that the gas pressure is so low that the proportion of ions which collide with gas molecules in the sheath is negligibly small, the current taken by the collector can be calculated in terms of the radii of the collector or sheath, the distribution of velocities among the ions arriving at the sheath boundary and the total drop of potential in the sheath. The current is independent of the actual distribution of potential in the sheath provided this distribution satisfies certain conditions. "Orbital Motion" equations for spherical and cylindrical collectors.-General formulas for the current are derived and the calculations are then carried out for collectors in a group of ions having velocities which are (A) equal and parallel; (B) equal in magnitude but of random direction; (C) Maxwellian; (D) Maxwellian with a drift velocity superimposed. In all cases the collector current becomes practically independent of the sheath radius when this radius is large compared with that of the collector. Thus the volt-ampere characteristics of a collector of sufficiently small radius can be used to distinguish between the different types of velocity distribution. General equations are also given by means of which the velocity distribution can be calculated directly from the volt-ampere characteristics of a sphere or cylinder. Special properties of the Maxwellian distribution.-For a collector of any shape having a convex surface, the logarithm of the current taken from a Maxwellian distribution is a linear function of the voltage difference between the collector and the gas when the collector potential is such as to retard arriving ions, but not when this potential is accelerating. This is a consequence of the following general theorem: Supposing for simplicity of statement that the surface of an electrode of any shape immersed in a Maxwellian distribution is perfectly reflecting, then the ions in the surrounding sheath will have a distribution (called DM) of velocities and densities given by Maxwell's and Boltzmann's equations, even in the absence of collisions between the ions, provided that there are in the sheath no possible orbits in which an ion can circulate without reaching the boundary; but if such orbits exist, the distribution will be DM except for the absence of such ions as would describe the circulating orbits. As another corollary of this theorem there is deduced an equation relating the solution of problems having inverse geometry. Finally it is indicated how the theorem can be applied to calculate the volt-ampere characteristic of A. F. Dittmer's "pierced collector" when placed in a Maxwellian distribution. The effect of reflection of ions at the collector surface in modifying currents calculated by the preceding equations is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1926 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {The first statistical survey of field line resonance (FLR) events is presented using magnetometer data from the entire MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging mission. Ultralow-frequency waves are an important tool for the magnetoseismology of the Hermean magnetosphere; this study provides a completely new window onto the resonance structures and plasma density distribution in the Hermean magnetosphere. Here we assess resonance events from two categories—toroidal resonances characteristic of the classical picture of FLRs in the terrestrial magnetosphere driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a more comprehensive approach including all observed transverse resonances with more relaxed polarization criteria. Two hundred twenty-three toroidal FLRs with characteristics consistent with Kelvin-Helmholtz-driven FLRs are found in the dayside Hermean magnetosphere. The fundamental frequencies of these waves are used to provide estimates of plasma mass density in the range of ∼ 1–650 amu/cm 3 . A further 343 transverse resonances are found which provide very similar density estimates to the Earth-like FLR population. Fundamental and harmonic frequencies from all 566 events are used to fit a power law to plasma mass density along the field lines. The equatorial plasma mass density is predicted to vary approximately with R −7.5 . The offset of the Hermean dipole into the northern hemisphere causes significant asymmetries in the standing wave structure. Due to the extreme warping (away from a dipolar configuration) of Mercury's magnetosphere by the solar wind, the fundamental toroidal mode is predicted to oscillate with a notably lower frequency than the fundamental poloidal mode, contrary to relative toroidal and poloidal frequencies modeled for Earth's magnetosphere.},

abstract = {Five spacecraft-plasma models are used to simulate the interaction of a simplified geometry Solar Probe Plus (SPP) satellite with the space environment under representative solar wind conditions near perihelion. By considering similarities and differences between results obtained with different numerical approaches under well defined conditions, the consistency and validity of our models can be assessed. The impact on model predictions of physical effects of importance in the SPP mission is also considered by comparing results obtained with and without these effects. Simulation results are presented and compared with increasing levels of complexity in the physics of interaction between solar environment and the SPP spacecraft. The comparisons focus particularly on spacecraft floating potentials, contributions to the currents collected and emitted by the spacecraft, and on the potential and density spatial profiles near the satellite. The physical effects considered include spacecraft charging, photoelectron and secondary electron emission, and the presence of a background magnetic field. Model predictions obtained with our different computational approaches are found to be in agreement within 2{\%} when the same physical processes are taken into account and treated similarly. The comparisons thus indicate that, with the correct description of important physical effects, our simulation models should have the required skill to predict details of satellite-plasma interaction physics under relevant conditions, with a good level of confidence. Our models concur in predicting a negative floating potential Vfl∼-10V for SPP at perihelion. They also predict a "saturated emission regime" whereby most emitted photo- and secondary electron will be reflected by a potential barrier near the surface, back to the spacecraft where they will be recollected. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

As a first step in the verification process, a comparison is made between the floating potential obtained with iPic3D and with Orbital Motion Limited theory for a spherical particle in a uniform stationary plasma. Second, the numerical model is verified for a CubeSat benchmark by comparing simulation results with those of PTetra for space environment conditions with increasing levels of complexity. In particular, we consider spacecraft charging from plasma particle collection, photoelectron and secondary electron emission. The influence of a background magnetic field on the floating potential profile near the spacecraft is also considered.

Since object charging is often nonlinear and involved, it is advisable to address this problem with numerical simulations.

One of such approaches is the particlein-cell (PIC) method, where the use of spatial grid for the force calculation significantly reduces the computational complexity. Implementing finite-sized objects in PIC simulations is often a challenging task.

@article{Lai2006,
abstract = {This paper is an overview of spacecraft charging in sunlight. The daylight photoelectron flux emitted from spacecraft surfaces normally exceeds the ambient electron flux. As a result, charging of spacecraft surfaces to positive voltage is expected to occur in sunlight. Indeed, spacecraft are often observed to charge to low positive voltages in sunlight. However, spacecraft can charge to high-level (kiloelectronvolts) negative voltages in sunlight. Why do spacecraft charge negatively in sunlight? One chief reason concerns differential charging between the sunlit and dark sides. For a satellite with dielectric surfaces, an electric field builds up on the shaded surfaces and then wraps around to the sunlit side to form a potential barrier that suppresses the photoemission. A monopole-dipole (for zero spin) or monopole-quadrupole model (for fast spin) describes the differential charging potential distribution due to blocked photoelectrons. It is shown that these cases are similar to a more general multipole potential field in that the surface node potentials satisfy an approximate linear relation. These cases are all driven by the shade side charging so that the onset for charging is approximately the same in sunlight or eclipse if conduction currents through the spacecraft can be neglected. If conduction currents are important, potential barriers can develop on the dark side, leading to suppression of the secondary emission currents and modification of charging onset. The results were briefly compared with observations. Another important reason for negative charging concerns reflectance. Highly reflective mirrors generate substantially reduced photoemission so that current balance can be achieved without barrier formation. The onset for charging in this case depends strongly on the reflectivity. The critical temperature for charging of surface materials under space substorm conditions with different ratios of photoemission current to electron ambient current, corresponding to varying satellite surface reflectivity values, was calculated. Numerical results, which show that with substantially reduced photoemission, highly reflective surfaces charge in sunlight with the critical temperature for onset decreasing with increasing reflectivity, are presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases?

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. We present a general model of the solar wind interaction with a dipolar lunar crustal magnetic anomaly (LMA) using three-dimensional full-kinetic and electromagnetic simulations. We confirm that LMAs may indeed be strong enough to stand off the solar wind from directly impacting the lunar surface, forming a so-called "minimagnetosphere," as suggested by spacecraft observations and theory. We show that the LMA configuration is driven by electron motion because its scale size is small with respect to the gyroradius of the solar wind ions. We identify a population of back-streaming ions, the deflection of magnetized electrons via the E × B drift motion, and the subsequent formation of a halo region of elevated density around the dipole source. Finally, it is shown that the presence and efficiency of the processes are heavily impacted by the upstream plasma conditions and, on their turn, influence the overall structure and evolution of the LMA system. Understanding the detailed physics of the solar wind interaction with LMAs, including magnetic shielding, particle dynamics and surface charging is vital to evaluate its implications for lunar exploration.
